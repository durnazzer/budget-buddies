        <li id="infotext"> Budgeting-Buddies is a website created by six college students
            that aims to help others, in the same age-range, become financially independent and financially secure.
            Becoming financially independent is a transition that almost every person goes through, around the time of their twenties.
            Many people have always relied on the older and more experienced people in their lives for finances.
            The struggle of not knowing how to manage or budget money is one of the biggest issues that hold recently independent, young-adults
            back from reaching their personal goals. Whether it is planning for travel, personal expenses, or emergencies, Budgeting-Buddies
            teaches everyone how to make smart financial decisions.  </li>
